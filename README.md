# Lab | Probability Distribution - Challenges

## Introduction

As a data analyst, you might need to use probability distribution for several reasons: 
- To analyze data to find useful patterns
- To make better data-driven decisions by answering questions like 'how likely it is that an observation of a random variable occurs'

## Getting Started

Open the `main.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. There are 2 exercises and in each exercise you will work with 2 different datasets. The datasets are in the same directory. Please keep in mind that you might also need to use some of the functions you saw in the previous lessons. Remember there is a common thread!

## Deliverables

- `main.ipynb` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
